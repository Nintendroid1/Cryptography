# Cryptography I - MATH 4175

These solutions are python programs intended to supplement the coursework for my Cryptography I class.

# affine.py
Encrypts and Decrypts strings using an affine cipher. Decrypt assumes alpha and beta are known.

# caesar.py
Encrypts and Decrypts strings using a caesar cipher. Decrypt will list possible sequences and their keys.

# validAffineKey.py
Lists the valid affine keys (alpha and beta) possible with a given n using gcd method

# vigenere.py
Encrypts and Decrypts strings using a vigenere cipher. Key needed for both.

# frequency.py
Counts the appearance of each letter of a ciphertext in relation to the standard english alphabet
